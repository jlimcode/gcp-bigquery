2. BigQuery internals and design

   
   1. What is BigQuery
3. Working with BigQuery

   
   1. Ways of accessing BigQuery: cloud console, command line tool, client library
   2. Cloud Console

      
      1. Create a table (max size 10GB)
      2. Query public datasets (max query output 1TB/month: use LIMIT)

         
         1. Star bigquery-public-data project
   3. Client Library

      
      1. Authentication - generating a key for local
      2. Exporting BigQuery job to Python notebook in Colab
4. Compare BigQuery manipulation speed vs. local manipulation with pandas. Or, for larger-than-memory, compare to dask speed.
